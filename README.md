# Candy Shop API
A Django REST Framework API made to be used with the frontend application 'CandyShop' 

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to serve as a backend for my concept application CandyShop, providing it with serialized JSON containing products, categories, discounts, user accounts, orders and more.

<hr>

The application is exactly as it sounds, a website which allows people to buy american candy, sweets
and confectionery. 

<p style="text-decoration: underline;">Pages</p>

- The website includes a Cup Configurator which will animatically fill up as the user chooses more sweets to
add to their sweet cup, the user can then add to their basket and complete their order.

- The website will also include a page solely for browsing and adding specific products to their basket, which expands the capabalities from a small amount of multiple sweets to a larger amount of specific sweets.

- Discounts will also be added which can be controlled by the companies web administrators which can be redeemed by the user.
